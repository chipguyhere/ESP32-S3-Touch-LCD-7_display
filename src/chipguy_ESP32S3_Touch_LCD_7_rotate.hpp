/*
 * chipguy_ESP32S3_Touch_LCD_7_rotate - 90/270-degree LVGL rendering for the
 * ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7, done at the LVGL->framebuffer level (the driver itself
 * keeps reading PSRAM forward at 0 degrees; see the README).
 *
 * LVGL runs in PARTIAL render mode with rotation set, so it hands us partial
 * areas + pixels in LOGICAL (portrait) coordinates; LvglRotatedRenderer rotates
 * each into one of the driver's two PHYSICAL (landscape) framebuffers and keeps
 * the two buffers consistent with a deferred dirty-rectangle scheme:
 *
 *   - flushRegion(): rotate-blit the area into the buffer we're building
 *     (FB[draw]); record it in `thisFrame`; and SUBTRACT it from `pending`
 *     (regions FB[draw] still lacks vs the scanned buffer) -- so pixels about to
 *     be overwritten next frame are never copied (e.g. while scrolling).
 *   - frameDone() (on LVGL's last flush of the frame): copy whatever remains in
 *     `pending` from the scanned buffer into FB[draw], swap buffers at vsync,
 *     then carry `thisFrame` forward as the new `pending`.
 *
 * Everything favors forward, long, sequential PSRAM access: the rotate-blit
 * writes each physical row as one contiguous run (reading the SRAM partial
 * buffer strided), and the reconciliation copy is row-major full-width memcpys.
